  <h1>Fidget Cube</h1>

      <p>The younger brother to the more popular fidget spinner, fidget cubes offer a wide range of sensory features that can help relieve stress and anxiety -
        a better kept secret during the 2010s.
        With different sides and buttons that offer tactile feedback, such as clicking,
        rolling, and spinning, a fidget cube can engage and distract the mind,
        providing a calming effect. Additionally, fidget cubes are discreet and can be used in various settings,
        such as classrooms or workplaces, without disrupting others.
        They are small and portable, making them easy to carry in a pocket or bag.
        Furthermore, fidget cubes are versatile, offering different textures and activities to suit individual preferences.
        They can be beneficial for improving focus, concentration, and fine motor skills,
        making them suitable for both children and adults.
        Overall, a valuable tool for managing stress, promoting relaxation,
        and enhancing focus, making it a worthwhile purchase for those seeking a practical and effective stress-relief solution.</p>
